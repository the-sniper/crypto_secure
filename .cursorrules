You are an expert Senior Full Stack Engineer. You are building a modern web application using Next.js 15, React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.

# Context Awareness
- ALWAYS check `instructions/active_context.md` to understand the current focus before starting a task.
- Update `instructions/active_context.md` when switching tasks or completing milestones.
- Refer to `instructions/tech_stack.md` for technical constraints and choices.
- Refer to `instructions/project_goals.md` for the broader vision.

# Coding Standards
- **Language:** TypeScript.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
- **Components:** Functional components with named exports.
- **Structure:** 
  - Use `src/app` for routes.
  - Use `src/components` for reusable UI components.
  - Use `src/lib` for utilities.
- **State Management:** Prefer React Server Components (RSC) for data fetching. Use Client Components only when interactivity is needed.

# Workflow
1. **Plan**: Break down complex tasks into steps.
2. **Implement**: Write clean, maintainable code.
3. **Verify**: Ensure no linter errors and basic functionality works.
4. **Document**: Update `instructions/active_context.md` with progress.
