# CryptoSecure - AI-Powered Smart Contract Security Scanner

An AI-powered security tool that analyzes TON smart contracts in seconds, identifies vulnerabilities, and provides actionable fixes—making blockchain security accessible to every developer.

---

## Problem Statement

The TON blockchain is experiencing explosive growth with integration into Telegram's 900+ million users, but this rapid expansion has created a critical security crisis:

- **14,995 vulnerabilities** were recently discovered across just 1,640 TON smart contracts (9+ bugs per contract on average)
- Smart contract bugs have led to **hundreds of millions of dollars stolen** across blockchain ecosystems
- Professional security audits cost **$10,000-$50,000** and take **2-4 weeks**, making them inaccessible to most developers
- Existing automated tools only catch syntax errors, missing critical semantic vulnerabilities
- Most TON developers lack security expertise, yet handle contracts managing real money

**The Result:** Developers launch vulnerable contracts, hackers exploit them, and users lose funds—undermining trust in the entire ecosystem.

## Our Solution

**TON Guardian** is an AI-powered security scanner that democratizes smart contract security by:

1. **Instant Analysis** - Scans FunC/Tact smart contracts in under 30 seconds (vs. weeks for manual audits)
2. **Comprehensive Detection** - Identifies 8+ vulnerability types including reentrancy, access control issues, integer overflow, unchecked returns, and TON-specific defects
3. **Plain English Explanations** - Translates technical vulnerabilities into understandable language with real-world impact descriptions
4. **Actionable Fixes** - Provides line-by-line recommendations and secure code alternatives
5. **Free Access** - Makes professional-grade security analysis available to every developer

**How It Works:**
```
Developer uploads contract code → AI analyzes against vulnerability database → 
Generates security score (0-100) → Highlights critical issues → 
Suggests specific fixes → Developer implements improvements
```

## Key Features (MVP)

1. **Smart Contract Upload** - Support for FunC and Tact languages via file upload or code paste
2. **AI-Powered Analysis Engine** - Leverages Claude AI to detect semantic vulnerabilities beyond basic syntax checking
3. **Security Score Dashboard** - Visual 0-100 security rating with breakdown by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
4. **Vulnerability Report** - Detailed findings with:
   - Issue description in plain language
   - Affected code lines
   - Potential exploit scenarios
   - Remediation steps with code examples
5. **Sample Vulnerable Contracts** - Pre-loaded test cases for demonstration
6. **Comparison View** - Before/after code showing secure alternatives

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- OpenAI API key (for Hacker Mode feature)

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
   
   Get your OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   
   **Note:** The regular security scan works without an API key, but Hacker Mode requires it.

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
